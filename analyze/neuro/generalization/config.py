"""Selection of best non-redundant models per run + the experiment matrix.

Train/test split matches the original runs (num_train=8, the 3 standard test
stories). New-subject runs reuse the identical stimuli on UTS01/UTS02. New-story
runs hold the same subject (UTS03) but evaluate on stories #8-10 of the shared
